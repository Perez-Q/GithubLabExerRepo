Programming Problem 1:
Statisticians would like to have a set of functions to compute the median and mode of a list of numbers. The median is the number that would appear at the midpoint of a list if it were sorted. The mode is the number that appears most frequently in the list. Define these functions in a module named stats.py. Also include a function named mean, which computes the average of a set of numbers. Each function expects a list of numbers as an argument and returns a single number.

Programming Problem 2:
Write a program that allows the user to navigate through the lines of text in a file. The program prompts the user for a filename and inputs the lines of text into a list. The program then enters a loop in which it prints the number of lines in the file and prompts the user for a line number. Actual linenumbers range from 1 to the number of lines in the file. If the input is 0, the program quits. Otherwise, the program prints the line associated with that number. 9
